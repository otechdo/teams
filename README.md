# Teams

A program to manage a rust team.

- It's purpose tools to:
  - Commit message
  - Generate change log
  - Create && finish features
  - Manage branches
  - Manages tags
  - Display tags
  - See git logs
  - Add && send modifications
  - Create a branch with stash
  - See branches with the latest commit
  - remove cargo dependencies
  - Use the `hunspell` dictionary for commit message
  - Install cargo project locally
  - No commit hooks necessary
  - Run test
  - Run clippy linter
  - Run `cargo fmt` automaticaly to format code source

> it's require `hunspell` command available and `en_US` dict installed.

## Commit Message Management with Cosmic Types

### What are they?

- **Commit Message Management:** The practice of writing clear, consistent, and informative commit messages to improve project collaboration and understanding.
- **Cosmic Commit Types:** A specific convention for commit messages that uses terms and concepts from astronomy and space exploration to categorise changes. This makes messages more engaging and easier to interpret.

### Why use commit message management?

- **Enhanced Collaboration:** Clear messages help team members understand the context and purpose of each change.

- **Improved History Tracking:** Well-structured commit logs make it easier to trace the development process, find specific changes, and generate meaningful changelogs.

- **Streamlined Review:** Concise and descriptive messages simplify code reviews and help identify potential issues faster.

- **1. Team Adoption:**

  - **Discuss and Agree:** Initiate a conversation with your team about using cosmic commit types. Explain the benefits, share this comprehensive guide, and gather feedback.
  - **Customise:** Collaboratively decide on the specific commit types you want to use. You can start with the comprehensive list provided here and tailor it to your project's specific needs and preferences.
  - **Document:** Create a clear and concise reference document outlining the chosen commit types, their meanings, and examples. Make this document easily accessible to all team members.

  **2. Implementation:**

  - **Manual Approach:** You can start using cosmic commit types manually by simply adhering to the `<type>(<scope>): <short summary>` format in your commit messages.
  - **Git Commit Template:** Create a Git commit template file (e.g., `.gitmessage`) to automatically populate the commit message format in your editor. This can help enforce consistency and remind contributors of the available commit types.
  - **Git Hooks:** Utilize Git hooks, like the `prepare-commit-msg` hook, to validate your commit messages and ensure they conform to the chosen format.
  - **Automated Tools:** Consider leveraging tools like `commitizen` or `cz-cli` that provide interactive prompts for creating commit messages according to your chosen convention. These tools can streamline the process and enforce consistency across your team.

  **3. Continuous Improvement:**

  - **Regular Review:** Periodically review your team's commit history to ensure consistent usage of the cosmic commit types and identify any areas where the format could be refined or improved.
  - **Feedback Loop:** Encourage open communication and feedback from your team members about the effectiveness of the chosen commit types and any suggestions for improvement.
  - **Iterative Refinement:** Don't be afraid to experiment and adapt the commit types to better suit your evolving project needs. The key is to find a system that works well for your team and enhances your Git workflow.

  **4. Continuous Improvement:**

  - **Encourage Creativity:** While maintaining consistency, allow team members to add their own flair and personality to the commit messages within the established framework.
  - **Celebrate Milestones:** Use special event commit types like "Moon Landing" to celebrate significant achievements and keep your team motivated.
  - **Integration with Other Tools:** Explore integration options with your issue tracking system, CI/CD pipeline, or documentation tools to automate processes and maximise the benefits of using cosmic commit types.

  By embracing this comprehensive guide and incorporating cosmic commit types into your Git workflow, you can transform your commit history into a vibrant, informative, and enjoyable reflection of your project's journey.

  The overall goal of Cosmic Commits is to make Git commit messages more informative, engaging, and enjoyable for developers, ultimately leading to better collaboration, maintainability, and understanding of the project's history.

### Why automate commit messages?

While Angular Commit Message Conventions provide a clear and structured format, enforcing it manually can be cumbersome and error-prone. Automated commit message generation tools help you:

- **Ensure Consistency:** All commit messages adhere to the convention, making the Git history more organized and easier to analyze.
- **Save Time:** Contributors don't have to manually format messages, leading to a more efficient workflow.
- **Reduce Errors:**  The tool guides contributors to create valid messages, preventing typos or inconsistencies.

### Why use cosmic commit types specifically?

- **Descriptive:** Terms like "Star" (new feature) or "Comet" (bug fix) are instantly recognisable and convey the nature of the change at a glance.
- **Engaging:** The cosmic theme adds a fun and memorable element to commit messages.
- **Standardised:** Provides a shared vocabulary and structured format for commit messages, improving consistency across the team.

### Why cosmos commit type ?

Cosmic commit types offer a unique and engaging way to categorise and describe changes in your Git commit history. Here's why they are beneficial:

**Enhanced Clarity and Communication:**

- **Descriptive Labels:** Using terms like "Star" for new features, "Comet" for bug fixes, or "Nebula" for refactoring instantly conveys the nature of the change to anyone reading the commit log. This improves communication and understanding within the team.
- **Visual Scanning:** The use of vivid imagery associated with celestial bodies and events makes it easier to quickly scan through a commit history and identify specific types of changes.
- **Contextual Information:** The optional addition of a scope within the commit message provides further context about which part of the code base was affected (e.g., "Star(UI)" for a new UI feature).

 **Improved Organisation and Maintainability:**

- **Structured Format:** The consistent format of cosmic commit messages (e.g., "Type(Scope): Short summary") makes the commit history more organised and easier to parse. This helps with tasks like generating change logs or filtering commits based on specific criteria.
- **Streamlined History:** A well-organised commit history makes it easier to track the evolution of the project, identify patterns, and quickly pinpoint the introduction of specific changes.

**Increased Engagement and Fun:**

- **Creative Expression:** The cosmic theme adds a touch of personality and fun to the often mundane task of writing commit messages. It can make the development process more enjoyable and engaging for the team.
- **Shared Vocabulary:** Using a common set of commit types fosters a sense of shared understanding and camaraderie within the team. It can also serve as a fun conversation starter or icebreaker.

**Automation and Tooling:**

- **Change log Generation:** Many tools can automatically generate change logs or release notes by parsing commit messages. Cosmic commit types make this process even easier by providing a clear structure and consistent vocabulary that tools can easily understand.
- **Issue Tracking Integration:** If you reference issue numbers in your commit messages, some tools can automatically link commits to their corresponding issues, streamlining your workflow and keeping your project management tools up-to-date
