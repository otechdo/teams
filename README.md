  tasks. It's like clearing out debris to ensure smooth operation.
* **Solar Flare:** Marks the addition or updating of tests, ensuring the codebase's reliability and stability. It's a
  burst of energy focused on quality assurance.
* **Dwarf Planet:** Represents minor but essential updates or fixes that don't fit into major categories. Think of it as
  a small but significant celestial body.
* **Terraform:** Specifically for commits related to infrastructure changes managed by Terraform, the "infrastructure as
  code" tool.

## **Special Event Commits**

* **Black Hole:** Signifies the removal of large chunks of code or features, often due to deprecation or major shifts in
  direction. It's a dramatic change that consumes old elements.
* **Wormhole:** Represents the merging of branches or connecting disparate parts of the codebase. It's a shortcut
  through the fabric of the project.
* **Big Bang:** Marks the very beginning of a project or a major new feature, signifying a momentous creation.
* **Launch:** Indicates the deployment of code to a production environment or the release of a new version to users.

## **Communication & Collaboration Commits**

* **Probe:** Denotes experimental features or exploratory work, indicating that the changes are not final.
* **Slingshot Maneuver:** Represents the act of reverting previous commits or changes due to errors or unintended
  consequences.

## **Advanced Commit Types**

* **Solar Wind:** This represents code refactoring aimed at improving the overall flow and maintainability, much like
  the solar wind's continuous stream of charged particles that shapes the solar system.
* **Lunar Eclipse:** Used when temporarily disabling or hiding a feature. It implies that the feature is not gone but
  merely obscured for a time, like the moon during an eclipse.
* **Cosmic Microwave Background:** Relates to adding logging, monitoring, or observability features to your code,
  allowing you to "see" deeper into the inner workings of your system, much like the cosmic microwave background
  radiation provides insights into the early universe.
* **Gravitational Wave:** Indicates subtle but impactful fixes or improvements. These changes, like gravitational waves,
  may be small but can have far-reaching consequences.
* **Event Horizon:** Marks significant, irreversible changes to the project, such as dropping support for older
  technologies or making major architectural shifts. It signifies crossing a point of no return, like the event horizon
  of a black hole.

## **Navigation & Exploration Commits**

* **Probe:** Denotes experimental features or exploratory work. It suggests that the changes are tentative and subject
  to further refinement, like a space probe venturing into unknown territory.
* **Slingshot Maneuver:** Indicates reverting previous commits or changes, like a spacecraft using a planet's gravity to
  alter its course.
* **Wormhole:** Used for merging branches or connecting disparate parts of the codebase, creating a shortcut between
  different sections of the project.

## **Space Exploration Commits**

* **Interstellar Communication:** Encompasses improvements to documentation, code comments, or any aspect that enhances
  communication and collaboration within the team. It emphasizes the importance of clear and open communication in a
  complex project.

## **Additional Tips & Best Practices**

* **Consistency is Key:**  Encourage your team to adopt the same set of commit types. This will streamline your commit
  history and make it easier to understand the evolution of the project.
* **Scope (Optional):**  Include a scope within parentheses after the commit type to provide more context. For
  example, `Pulsar(API)` indicates that the performance improvement specifically targets the API.
* **Concise Summaries:** Keep your commit summaries brief and to the point, ideally under 50 characters. This will help
  others quickly grasp the essence of the change.
* **Body (Optional):** For more complex changes, provide a detailed description in the commit message body, separated
  from the summary by a blank line.
* **Reference Issues:** If your commit addresses a specific issue, mention it in the summary or body using a keyword
  like "fixes," "closes," or "resolves," followed by the issue number.
* **Breaking Changes:** If your commit introduces a breaking change, prefix the commit type with "!" (
  e.g., `!Star(API): Introduce v2 API with breaking changes`).

# **Using the Tool**

If you're using a tool like "zuu commiter" mentioned earlier, it can automate much of the process for you. It can prompt
you to select a commit type, enforce the correct format, and even run code quality checks before allowing you to commit.

## **Example Workflow**

1. Make your desired changes to the codebase.
2. Run the commit helper tool (e.g., `commiter`).
3. Select the appropriate commit type from the list.
4. Provide a concise summary of your changes.
5. (Optional) Add a more detailed description in the body if necessary.
6. Review the generated commit message and confirm.

## **Benefits of Using Cosmic Commit Types**

* **Enhanced Clarity:**  The descriptive and imaginative nature of these commit types makes it easier to understand the
  purpose of each commit at a glance.
